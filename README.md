# Emerging-Technology-Assessments
This repository contains solutions to the various module exercises that we were tasked with during the course of the semester. All tasks were first researched and then develped using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Getting Started

#### Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 

https://jupyter.org/


#### Cloning the Repo
Create a directory on your local machine. Open the directory and type the following command:
> $ git clone https://github.com/AntoMoore/Emerging-Technology-Assessments

#### Launching the Jupyter Notebook
Once inside the project directory containing the Jupyter Notebook, type the following command:
> $ python -m notebook

## Task 1
Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the **square root of 2** to **100 decimal places**. The calculation should not depend on any librarys that need to be imported. Research the task and include references with a discription of how the algorithm functions.

#### Features
- Newton's Method
- Large Integer Values using Exponential Multipliers 
- List Comprehension

## Task 2
The Chi-squared test for independence is statistical hypothesis test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article on the test for independence gives the table below as an example, stating the **chi-squared** value based on it is approximately **24.6**. The objective is to use *scipy.stats* and leverage the chi-squared test for independence, to verify the given statical values and calculate the associated p value.

#### Features
- scipy.stats
- Pearson's Chi-squared Test
- Contingency Table

## Task 3
The objective is to research the two different implementations of the standard deviation function used by Microsoft excel library and highlight the differences between them. These functions are *STDEV.P* and *STDEV.S* respectively. Then use **NumPy** to perform a simulation demonstrating that the *STDEV.S* calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.

#### Features
- Standard Deviation on a Sample
- Standard Deviation on a Population
- numpy.std()
- Percentage Difference

## Task 4
Using **scikit-learn** to apply **k-means** clustering to
**Fisherâ€™s Iris data set**. Explain how the program works and how accurate it might be. Then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of Iris.

#### Features
- Fisher's Iris Data Set
- KMeans Clustering
- Matplotlibs
- 3D Graphs
- 4D Graphs
